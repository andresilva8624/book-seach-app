# Book Search Engine App


![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AndreGitHub-MIT-green.svg)

This search engine app is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
